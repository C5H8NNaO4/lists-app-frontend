# 28.08.2023

We fixed a lot of minor bugs in the application.
    * Import didn't work for when data contained lists without titles
    * Poor contrast with buttons when background turned on
    * Poppers had portals disabled leading
    * z-index issues
    * deleting the due time of an item didn't update the ui
  
We remodeled the UI to make it more like Google Keeps UI. This is to make lists in the next row visible on small screens.
